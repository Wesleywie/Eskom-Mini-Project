# Fixing-Eskom-with-Graphs
Using Graph ADT, the problem of Eskoms load shedding crisis was solved using graph ADT for load balancing of electricity.

Problem: 
In South Africa our national power supplier has difficulties of supplying power consistently.
Due to this South African Citizens experience “Load Shedding” or blackouts.

Solution:
Load balancing Eskom.

Target: 
Load Centre demand.
Coal Stations(Capacity and Production).

Output:
Efficient Load balancing of Coal Stations. 
Based on Load Centre Demand

Implementation:

Capture: Input Coal Stations , Weights, Costs.

Process: Creates graph, traverses and Calculates Load balance.

Output: Constructed graph.Information needed for solution.
